# Datasets

Datasets are divided into 2 different experimental settings:
1. Setting1 -> Refers to 20fold cross validation as in LeNup work. Directory contains fasta file  with both nucleosomes and linkers sequencies
1. Setting2 -> Extract random with replacement 100 Datasets, each of them contains 100 Nucleosome and 100 Linker. Directory contains for every genome location:
   1. a fasta file with both nucleosomes and linkers
   1. bed file for sequence extraction
   1. 100Dataset directory that contains fasta files for every extracted dataset
